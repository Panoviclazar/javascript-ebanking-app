# e-Banking app

This is the simple but cool responsive e-banking demo app, to use it just enter username and pin of one of the two existing accounts, and you will have full access. Both of these information is stored in javascript file named app.js, in account1 and account2 objects, but i will leave it here also : Account1(username: petar, pin: 1111), Account2(username: marija, pin: 2222).

This is one of the projects that i learned from Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete javascript course, and it is all done from my own knowledge learned from his course, the design of the app is basically his with my addition of dark mode, responsive design and some changes, and all of credits goes to him.

Thank you for reviewing and testing this app, if you have any advice to give me or perhaps a remark, please feel free to contact me at my email address lazarpanovic@yahoo.com .
